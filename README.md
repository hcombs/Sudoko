Sudoko Puzzle for Graphical Application Design Class

I made the original Sudoku puzzle in C# using WinForms. I recreated this project in javascript because I plan on placing it on my personal website for my portfolio. I use a backtracking algorithm to create the puzzle.

A video of the old project can be seen [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hUSE0_69rw)
